To install, run 
```
pip install pip+git@github.com:turtleoxford/turtle-python.git
```

For development against the examples, run this in the root of the repository:
```
$ poetry shell
(turtle-oxford-py3.10) $ python examples/game_of_life.py
```

This creates a python virtual environment with all the necessary depedencies and lets you use the turtle_oxford module in the examples while still allowing you to edit it.
